# Warriors Modern Theme

## Activate
1. WordPress Admin -> Appearance -> Themes.
2. Activate **Warriors Modern**.
3. Appearance -> Menus -> assign your main menu to **Primary Menu**.
4. Settings -> Reading -> ensure homepage is set to your Home page.

## Notes
- Theme is donation-first and intentionally simple.
- Front page pulls events from `https://hq.pghwarriorhockey.us/api/public/events`.
- CTA links route to HQ (`/login`, `/register`, `/player`) and site public pages.
